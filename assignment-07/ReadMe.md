(I named these as V1's because I didn't have time to create the level I designed (as a paper prototype), though I did technically fulfill the checklist of requirements, but still hope to finish the level I designed and share that. Though I may need to redesign my planned level a bit, as I planned on starting in an indoors section, but there doesn't really seem to be many included models that facilitate such.)

(Different Assignment I had this week, but happens to be somewhat similar to this assignment, and I happened to spend more time on it, so just thought I'd share it.)
